This script search for MP3's in the specified folders and moves them into the destination folder.

Requires bash 4+.

Basic usage:

`mp3s-to-kodi/main --search=/folder1 --search=/folder2 --destination=/destination_folder/example`

Files are not re-copied if they already exist in the destination folder.

This script was built using [Shource](https://github.com/oliverisaac/shource), my bash pre-processor to speed bash script development.
